    <b>About Us</b> <br>
    <p>
    When our youth are empowered with the right skills to innovate and create solutions,
     they unlock the opportunities for new businesses that will drive our economies forward. 
     This is why we support these young innovators, founders, next generation coders and 
     digital creatives.</p>
    <p>
    In 2012 mLab Southern Africa (Mobile Applications Laboratory NPC) launched as a mobile 
    technology accelerator with the aim of supporting innovative new startups and to unlock 
    the mobile apps economy. Since then we have grown into an open innovation lab which 
    includes programmes that support skills development through our own and partner code
     academies, facilitated co-creation seasons with industry and public sector partners
      and we continue to build on our successes as a local tech start-up lab.</p>
    
      <p>
    mLab Southern Africa is a registered Nonprofit organisation and Level 1 B-BBEE service 
    provider focusing on Skills and Enterprise Development as well as Lean Innovation 
    Facilitation and Supplier Development Support. We have proudly partnered with 
   founding partners The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, The Department of 
   Science & Technology, The Innovation Hub, The CSIR, The V&A Waterfront and the World Bank.</p>
    
    
    <!-- What is a Start-up Lab vs. traditional incubators or accelerators?
    
    A laboratory (British English: /ləˈbɒrətəri/ or/ləˈbɒrətri/, American English: 
    /ˈlæbərətɔːri/ or/ˈlæbrətɔːri/; informally, lab) is a facility that provides controlled 
    conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement
     may be performed. As a start-up Lab we provide a controlled environment and process to 
     experiment forward from a concept or idea to a minimal validated product that can be 
     further tested, iterated and scaled in market (published to app stores or piloted).
    
    An Incubator is a place, especially with support staff and equipment, made available 
    at low rent to new small businesses.
    
    An Accelerator is a person or thing that causes something to happen or develop more
     quickly. In the start-up economy this is typically structured as a short but intensive
      and focused programme.   -->
